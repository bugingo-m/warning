		<h3 className="definition" style={{marginTop:'1.5rem'}}>what is the warning?</h3>
		<p className="def-details">
		Imagine entering a movie theatre and taking a seat. As the film starts rolling, 
		you feel intense unease: the feature film is nothing other than your entire life in review specifically, all the sins you have committed. It's impossible to budge or even close your eyes. The film keeps rolling straight to the end. However, the most unendurable part of the experience is your keen understanding that God is at your side watching the film with you.
		 You feel exactly what He feels. No one else is in the theatre.
		</p>
		<p>
		The Illumination of Conscience, a preview of the Last Judgment, will come as a warning and also an invitation to get our life right with God, to move away from the person we were before the Illumination and become a new person pleasing to Him. It will be a supernatural event coming directly from God, and will happen over the entire earth. It will be a moment when all the rays of the Sun will be darkened, 
		and that darkness will cover the entire world. Then a brilliant light will appear in the sky, followed by a sign of Jesus on the Cross, and from His wounds will be projected rays of light that will 
		illuminate every person’s conscience.
		</p>
		<p><strong>
		God will pause time: airplanes in midair will stop, cars on the road will halt, and people walking and running will be instantly stopped in motion. 
		Everything in the world will be suspended during the Illumination.
		</strong></p>
		<p>
		God will direct His attention to each person, believer or non-believer alike. 
		<strong> Every person will see the state of their soul as God sees it. 
		They will see something like a video of all the good and bad that had occurred in their life up to the moment of the Illumination. 
		They will see their sins and the consequences of those sins on people.</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
		During this experience, God will infuse each soul with His Truth; thereby, correcting the conscience of mankind. Through this action, the grace of God’s Truth will flow into the soul, penetrate it, illuminate it, and raise it to an enlightened state of understanding where the soul will know that God exists, maybe for the first time. For some, the feeling in their hearts will be worse than sorrow; it will be like an internal fire that doesn’t burn the flesh. It will be revealed to each person the path that their soul is on: 
		the path to salvation or the path to damnation.
		</p>
		<p>
		It is through God’s love and mercy for mankind that the Illumination
		 will occur because He loves us so much that He wants to give each of us the opportunity to choose Heaven and eternal joy by fulfilling His will. But He also gives us the free will to make our own choice: the path to Heaven or the path to Hell. If we choose the path to Heaven, then there is likely some repentance required for most of us.
		</p>
		<h3 style={{margin:'0.5rem 0',marginTop:'1.5rem'}}><strong>Who received the Prophecy of the Illumination of conscience?</strong></h3>
		<p>The Illumination will happen with prior knowledge of the event. It was foretold to saints, seers and mystics through the centuries. Some trace the idea of this global event back to a 16th century martyr, <strong>Saint Edmund Campion</strong>, who 
		<strong>“pronounced a great day, not wherein any temporal 
		potentate should minister, but wherein the Terrible Judge should 
		reveal all men’s consciences and try every man of each kind of religion.”</strong></p>
		<p>
		A seer named <strong>Elizabeth Canori-Mora</strong> had a vision in 1825 
		in which <strong>“a great light appeared upon the earth which was 
			the ‘sign of the reconciliation’ of God with man.”</strong> 
			In 1836 <strong>Blessed Anna Maria</strong> Taigi had a vision 
			of a future event in which <strong>“a great purification will come upon 
				the world preceded by an ‘illumination of conscience’ in which everyone 
				will see themselves as God sees them.”</strong>
		</p>
		<p>Probably the most well-known are the alleged apparitions at Garabandal, 
			Spain in the early 1960’s, where Our Lady, 
			manifesting herself as Our Lady of Mount Carmel, gave the Warning message to 
			four young girls. She told them that the Warning will happen when conditions on 
			the earth were at their worst. <strong>Conchita Gonzalez</strong>, one of the visionaries, 
			said, 
			<strong>“The warning comes directly from God … and will be seen and felt in all 
			parts of 
			the world by every person.”</strong> Another of the visionaries, 
			<strong>Jacinta Gonzalez</strong>, 
			not related to Conchita, 
			had said: <strong>"The warning is something that is first seen in the air, 
			everywhere in the world and immediately is transmitted into the interior 
			of our souls. It will last for a very little time, but it will seem 
			a very long time 
			because of its effect within us. It will be for the good of our souls, 
			in order to see in ourselves our conscience... the good that we 
			have failed to do, and the bad that we have done. 
			Then we will feel a great love toward our heavenly 
			Parents and ask forgiveness for all our offenses. 
			The warning is for everybody because God wants our salvation. 
			The warning is for us to draw closer to Him and to increase our faith.”
			</strong></p>
			<p>A month before <strong>St. Padre Pio</strong> died in 1968, he told Joachim Bouflet, a Frenchman, to consecrate himself to the Virgin of Carmel who appeared at Garabandal 
				and that the alleged apparitions there were true.</p>
			<p>There were other saints and mystics as well, who received knowledge of this event, 
				including: <strong>St. Faustina Kowalska</strong> in 1934 in Poland, whom Jesus told: 
				<strong>"All light 
				in the heavens will be extinguished, and there will be great darkness 
				over the whole earth. Then the sign of the cross will be seen in the 
				sky, and from the openings where the hands and the feet of the Savior 
				were nailed will come forth great lights which will light up the earth 
				for a period of time. This will take place shortly
				 before the last day."</strong> [Diary 83]; Modern mystic <strong>Maria Esperanza</strong> said, <strong>“The consciences of this beloved people must be violently
				  shaken so that they may ‘put their house in order’… A great moment is approaching, 
				a great day of light… it is the hour of decision for mankind.”
				</strong></p>
				<h3  style={{margin:'0.5rem 0',marginTop:'1.5rem'}}><strong>After the warning!</strong></h3>
				<p>
				Immediately following the Warning, it is prophesied that there will be a period of about 40 days or approx. 6 weeks where the devil will be chained (not be allowed to act). 
				This way, everyone will have a chance to make their choice for or against God.
				</p>
				<p>
				We are told to expect mass conversions to the Catholic faith. There may be long, long lines for confession, and priests may need you to bring them food because they will be hearing confessions 
				all day long with no breaks. Baptisms may need to be done in masses.
				</p>
				<p>
				Many people may have had a very difficult Warning experience and may be feeling a lot of anxiety and worry– they might need you to coach them through it. They may have had little or no catechesis and will need you to instruct 
				them in the faith because the priests will have no time, so keep a Catechism handy!
				</p>
				<p>
				Following the 40 days of conversion, scientists may say that they have discovered an explanation 
				for what happened and that it was just a "collective illusion."
				</p>
				<p>
				Our Lady of Garabandal prophesied that within a year of the Warning there will be a Great Miracle on the pines at Garabandal (messengers have said that this miracle will appear on other apparition sites of Our Lady as well). There will be no scientific explanation 
				for this miracle, and this will be a testament to the truth of the Warning.
				</p>
				<p>
				Then when the Antichrist comes to reign for a period of a few years (the Great Tribulation) many of God's people may have to be 
				hidden away by the angels in places of refuge, while others will be martyred.
				</p>
				<p>
				Prophesies say that the reign of the Antichrist will be brought to an end by a Great Chastisement from God known as the 3 Days of Darkness where all of the demons and evil 
				people will be sent back into Hell. But, God's faithful remnant will be protected.
				</p>
				<p>
				After the 3 Days of Darkness we are told that there will be a Period of Peace where Christ will reign in our hearts and the words of the Our Father, "Thy Will be done, on Earth as it is in Heaven" 
				will be fulfilled. This Period of Peace is spoken about in the book of Revelation.
				</p>
				<p>
				Finally, 
				satan will be again unleashed just prior to the Second Coming of Christ and the End of the World.
				</p>
				<p>Let us <Link to='/preparations'>prepare</Link> for this day, 
				for it will come as a thief! <em><strong>For just as the days of Noah were, 
				so will be the coming of the Son of Man. For in those days before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day Noah entered the ark. And they did not understand until the flood 
				came and swept them all away. So shall it be at the coming of the Son of Man. Matthew 24:37-39. </strong></em>May the Almighty God bless us.</p>
