    <p>We must always be prepared. We have to get ready for God’s judgment. Remember the world’s standards we live in are a false indication of God’s justice. We should strive to bring as 
      many others as we can to be prepared for the Divine illumination.<strong>
      &nbsp;Remember we don't know the time,preparing as if it is going to happen now is the best way. 
      </strong> Below are some of the ways that can help us prepare for that great day.</p>
